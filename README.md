# Quick Jumpbox Using AWS Free Tier

If you have a homelab, you probably want to be able to access it when you're away from home. This is easy to accomplish using a VPN. However, if you want to access your homelab during your lunch break, or maybe you want to access your homelab during working hours (I do some development work on my home server that I plan to port over to some work projects when it's ready to be pushed to production) you probably need a jumpbox. You most likely can't VPN directly to your homelab from your work computer, so you have to use a jumpbox.
